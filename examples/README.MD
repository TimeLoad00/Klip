This folder contains a bunch of example code that works with the Klip programming language. In order to use the example code you must have built both the KlipRT and KlipCompiler or download the KlipBundleC#.zip file which already has the generated .exe files for the KlipRT and KlipCompiler.

All of these examples utilise the "system" library. You must have the system.txt file in the same folder when attempting to execute any of the example code.
